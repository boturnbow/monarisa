title:  "Deck Hold Downs"
---

The Tiki plans call for a combination of swivels and securing blocks to hold the decks in place. After experience with the Tiki 21 in Ghana I wanted to try something different. Instead I added blocks to the struts on the beams to hold the decks down from the fore and aft ends instead of the sides. I was able to use the same design for the center and side decks and the fore deck as well.
