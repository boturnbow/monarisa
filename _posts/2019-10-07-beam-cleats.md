title:  "Beam Cleats"
---

Hey - I've done this [before]({% post_url 2019-02-27-beam-sockets-cleats %}) - and [before]({% post_url 2019-03-30-winter-in-ghana %})! I created new beam cleats out of ash and attached them with epoxy and a couple of screws. After curing, I removed the screws and added three 1/4" bolts to each cleat. I then added cosmetic fillets around the outside of each cleat. I also added a bigger fillet inside the cabin above each cleat at the hull/deck joint.
