I gather that it's a momentous day in a build to flip the hulls. And it sure felt like progress to me! The actual flipping was quick and easy. I laid the hulls on their sides on some tires while I removed the cradles. And with just a few shims, I was able to reuse the wheeled cradles with the hulls in the upside down position. Thanks to a few friends for helping!
