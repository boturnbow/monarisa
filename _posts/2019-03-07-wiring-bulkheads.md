title:  "Wiring the First Hull Together"

*Build Date: June 2018*

The building plans give a specific order for wiring in the bulkheads. I followed that order. It was difficult to get a bulkhead aligned and tightened the first time. The best technique was to insert a bulkhead loosely and then insert the next bulkhead before going back and aligning and tightening the first. There was a **lot** of tension in the hull sides that wanted to shoot the bulkheads up so it was important to angle the wires for a downwards pull. The stern was hard to pull together and required pipe clamps and patience. But in the end everything aligned correctly.
