Winter was making it too difficult to keep working with epoxy in an unheated and uninsulated garage so it was time to put the boat away for a few months. Friends helped me flip the boat and load it onto the trailer. This was the first time that these hulls had been on the trailer. I was happy to see that the bunks fit the hulls just right.
