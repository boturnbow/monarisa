The plans call for adding the deck beams to the bulkheads before putting them into the hulls. I decided to also add the bunk bearers at the same time. It seemed like it would be a lot easier with them out of the hull. I coated both sides of the bulkheads with two coats of pigmented epoxy.

At this point, some of the deck beams needed to be cut to accept the deck stringers. The plans call for triangular deck stringers. I wanted to use rectangular or square stringers because that would be easier to mill. But I liked the idea of a triangular mortise in the deck beams because that would be easy to cut. So I mocked up an easy way to cut a triangular tenon on the table saw.
