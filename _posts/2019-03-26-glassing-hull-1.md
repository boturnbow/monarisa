Honestly, I was intimidated to fiberglass 21 feet of hull in one go. But I had done smaller jobs on Super Chicken and I had seen a few videos so it was time to give it a go. The weather at this time was a blessing and a curse. It was cold so I would have a long open time when working. But it was too cold to cure so I had to construct a tent inside the garage with a heater inside to raise the temperature for curing. The tent made work difficult because the light was poor inside.

I laid the glass out on the boat and trimmed it with good overlaps to reinforce the keel and skeg. I know that there is a debate about whether you should first put a coat of epoxy on the wood before fiberglassing or not. Devlin's preference is to not and that worked fine for me as well.

When it came time to epoxy down the fiberglass I mixed large batches and applied with a plastic scraper and a chip brush around the edges. The scraper was great at getting too much epoxy out of the weave and preventing drips.
