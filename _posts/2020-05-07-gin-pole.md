On my previous boat, a MacGregor 22, I could raise the mast singlehanded without any mechanical assistance. I was hoping to do the same again, but after using brute force I realized that the boat layout was working against me. In the MacGregor I could stand right at the stern of the boat, grab the mast and lift and walk forward to the mast base. Since the Tiki doesn't have a deck all the way to the stern I had to start my lifting much farther down on the mast where the leverage was working against me. So I needed some kind of engineered solution.
