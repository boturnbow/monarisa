*Build Date: May 2018*

I had a burst of enthusiasm after making the decision to rebuild the hulls. So I didn't wait for the marine plywood order to arrive. I bought some 3/4" ash and started milling parts for the sheerstringers, keels, sheerstringer doublers, beam cleats, and beam blocks. I scarfed shorter pieces together for the sheerstringers and keels. The building plans call for two different kinds of scarfs for these pieces as you can see in the photos.
