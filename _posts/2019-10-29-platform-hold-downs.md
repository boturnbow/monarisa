title:  "Platform Hold Downs"
---

The Tiki plans call for a combination of swivels and securing blocks to hold the platforms in place. After experience with the Tiki 21 in Ghana I wanted to try something different. Instead I added blocks to the struts on the beams to hold the platforms down from the fore and aft ends instead of the sides. I was able to use the same design for the center and side platforms and the fore platform as well.
