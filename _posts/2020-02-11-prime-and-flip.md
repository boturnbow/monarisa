What a thrill to actually put some paint on the hulls!! Even if it was only primer. I prepped the cabin sides with light sanding, but didn't put any sandpaper to the nonskid on the decks. I washed everything well with hot water and vinegar to remove any amine blush. And then I rolled on a latex primer and was happy with coverage after two coats. I masked off the beam sockets and the tops of the "luggage racks" so that I can glue on some rubber pads there later.

After a little curing time, with the assistance of some good helpers and old tires we rolled the hulls over. Now it's time to finish the bottoms.
