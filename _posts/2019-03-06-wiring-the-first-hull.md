*Build Date: June 2018*

The building plans give explicit instructions on wiring the hulls together. I deviated from them a little bit because I was using 3/4" material for the keel instead of 5/8". Otherwise, I followed them exactly and was very happy with the results. It's starting to look like a boat already!!
