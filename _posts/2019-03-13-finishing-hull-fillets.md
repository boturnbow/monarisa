I quickly got into a rhythm on the hull fillets. For each hull section, I would prep by sanding and cleaning, aligning the hull, and cutting the fiberglass tape. Then I could do all the filleting and taping for a section in a couple of hours. I applied the fillet mixture out of the cut-off corner of a plastic bag. And then smoothed to the proper radius with tools cut from plastic auto body repair scrapers. I laid the fiberglass tape in the wet fillet and then smoothed with a dry foam roller and filled with neat epoxy using a chip brush.

After the filets had dried for a day I would pull all the wires. I worked from the ends towards the middle and kept aligning as I went. The hulls quickly started feeling very stiff and strong. What a transformation!

After all the fillets were done, I lightly sanded and cleaned the bilges and lockers. And then I applied three coats of water-based house paint with a foam roller.
