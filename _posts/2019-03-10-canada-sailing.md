title:  "Sailing On a Mana 24 in Canada"
---

In mid-July 2018, I went to Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, Canada to sail with my friend [Rod on his Mana 24](https://villagerainbows.com). We became friends on Facebook via the Wharram groups because we were both working on Wharrams at the same time. Rod had also built a Tiki 21 in the past so I was curious to sail on his new boat and talk about his old boat. Remember, at this point I have **never sailed on a Wharram!** My only catamaran experience is a small Hobie cat in college.

Annually, Rod gathers several friends for this sail trip called the Elbow Run. The idea is to sail for a week or so and just see how many miles are made to and fro on the big lake. We had some very windy conditions on day 1 and a big chop to deal with at the junction of the T-shaped lake. The Mana handled things well ... until **the main mast fell down!**

Luckily, neither of us was hurt. The problem occurred where the Dyneema shrouds were spliced around a shackle at the top of the mast. The splice was loose and sawed back and forth in the big waves. Good to know since I am using Dyneema shrouds as well. Though the trip was cut short I took a lot of pics of things I liked about the Mana and Rod's workmanship. It was also interesting to see a boat built from a CNC kit.
