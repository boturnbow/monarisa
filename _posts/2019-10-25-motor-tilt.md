title:  "Motor Tilt"
---

The tilt mechanism on my outboard is designed for a sloped transom and won't raise the motor very far out of the water when it's on the **vertical** transom of the Tiki's center platform. So I attached a rubber V block to the underside of the aft beam and a clam cleat above it. I'll be able to use a short line to snug the bottom of the motor up against the rubber block.
