When the paint had cured for a few days I put a couple of coats of wax on the parts of the decks and cabins that weren't non-skid. Then I got to work on finishing things up.

## Padding the Beam Sockets

Before priming I had masked off the areas where I wanted to add padding to the beam sockets. With the tape removed I could glue right to the epoxy instead of the paint. First, I decided to glue on some old bike inner tubes. Using the tubes it was easy to add protection to the sides of the beam sockets as well. And then I added foam padding to the bottoms of the sockets. I used contact cement for all the gluing.

I also added a piece of inner tube to the top of each luggage rack for some protection and grip there.

## Attaching Fore Hatches

The fore hatches are attached with rope hinges that are different than the rudder rope hinges because the rope doesn't go through individual holes. I think these are easier to build and align, but I had to think about securing the ends more. In Ghana I used similar hatch hinges and started and finished each hinge with clove hitches. Those seemed to work loose over time so I just used half hitches this time. We'll see what happens. I'm leaving the tails long for now in case I need to re-think it.

Here are the specifics for my future reference:

 * line is 2.2mm Dyneema
 * stevedore knot tied in bitter end and then half-hitched around deck half of hinge
 * six figure eights for the hinge
 * finished with two half-hitches around deck half of hinge and then overhand stopper as tight as I could

## Bow Light

I installed the base for my Navisafe [bow light](https://www.duckworks.com/product-p/nav-340.htm).
