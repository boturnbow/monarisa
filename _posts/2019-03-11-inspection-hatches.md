I stole an idea from Rod's Mana 24 and built my own inspection hatch covers for the bows and sterns. I had saved the 9" round plastic screw-in hatches from the original boat, but after I saw this design I knew it would work better than the plastic ones - which were already breaking and missing O-rings. I built the gaskets out of old bicycle tubes glued together with contact cement.
