title:  "Mis-Adventures in Beam Sockets"
---

Ugh. I had a long, rough time getting the beam pads and sockets properly constructed. I started by leveling the hulls with shims under the trolley wheels. Then I leveled the beams in their spots with a line level.

 I created cardboard templates of the sockets and cut them out of single pieces of white oak. I glued and screwed them in place and was pretty happy with myself until I added the beam blocks to the under side of the beams and found that I hadn't left enough room under the beams for the blocks!

I also found that my technique for leveling the hulls didn't work that well and the beams weren't sitting flush when tied down.
