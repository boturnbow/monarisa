With the fiberglass on the coamings, it was time to install the fasteners for the main hatches. I installed the fabric side of the Lift the Dot fasteners into the hem of the hatch covers. It was a slow process with a punch and an Exacto knife but the offical tool is $80 - ha! On the coaming, I marked and overdrilled the holes and filled them with thickened epoxy.

The hatches were snug when closed and worked well in the partly open position. I'll need to decide if I want to modify the canvas seats to fit around the fastener studs. I'll also need to decide how to secure a hatch when sleeping in a cabin.
