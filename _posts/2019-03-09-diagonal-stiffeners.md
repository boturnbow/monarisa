*Build Date: July 2018*

With the hulls together, the next step was adding diagonal stiffeners and backing pads for the forebeam cleats and shrouds. The plans call for triangular stock or round stock. I didn't want to mill triangular stock and couldn't find half-round in the right size so I went with rectangular stock. I imagined that there was a chance water could collect on the upper joint along the stiffeners so I put a fillet along all the top joints. When gluing I used some sacrificial blocks to keep the wires from biting into the stiffeners.
