title:  "Tiller Bar and Extension"
---

I needed to modify the tiller bar that I [built previously]({% post_url 2019-02-16-tillers-and-tiller-bar %}) because the newest tillers had more curvature to them and were thus closer together at the ends. The new tiller pins were located about 2" inboard of the previous holes.

I drilled the new holes and trimmed the tiller bar to fit. I also added epoxy with graphite to the pin holes and underside of the tiller bar.

I built a tiller extension out of an oak dowel with a handle cut from lamination scraps. The original boat had a tiller extension and I re-used the original hardware from it.
