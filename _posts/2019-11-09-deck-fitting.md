title:  "Fitting the Decks"
---

[Flash back to 2017]({% post_url 2019-02-15-rebuilding-platforms %}) to see when I first built the decks for the original hulls and the original beams. Those hulls were shaped a little differently along the side of the cabin where they meet the side decks. The old beams were even more different than the current ones because they had **no fillets** on them.

With the beams fitted, I could modify the decks to fit the new hulls and beams. The curve on the side decks needed some tweaking but luckily I only needed to remove material and not add any. On all the decks, the bottom edge of the fore and aft ends of the decks needed to be rolled over to fit around the fillets. Also the cutouts for the beam struts needed to be enlarged since the current struts are a little wider and positioned a little differently. After cutting and sanding, the bare wood needed two coats of epoxy before painting.
