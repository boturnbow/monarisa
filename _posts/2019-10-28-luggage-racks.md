title:  "Luggage Racks"
---

I decided to add "luggage racks" to the rear decks. I thought it would be a great place to store gasoline and propane tanks. I know rear netting is common but decided to try this instead. The ash cleats are glued and screwed in place with some big fillets around them as well.

BTW - there's my new router. I had to replace it after my garage was broken into and my bike and best tools were stolen :(
