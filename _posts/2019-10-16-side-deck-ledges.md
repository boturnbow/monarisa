title:  "Side Deck Ledges"
---

With the beams fitted I could mark on the cabin sides where the ledges for the side decks would be located. I beveled the top edges of the ledges for good support for the decks. Wire stitches helped get the placement correct and screws from the inside clamped it tight. Cosmetic fillets covered up the wire holes.
