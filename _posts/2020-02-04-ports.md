title:  "Drilling Holes for Ports and Windows"
category: building

Before I finished the epoxy on the cabins I wanted to drill all the holes needed to mount the ports and windows on the cabins. The original hulls came with some opening port holes. I am reusing them in the fore part of the cabins hoping to get air flow from fore to aft. I also had some plexiglass cut last year to mount in the aft part of the cabins for a view out when inside.

This was a dull job - just marking and drilling. The most important thing for me to record here is the method I used to drill holes in the plexiglass **without cracking it**. I combined some advice from a few sites on the internet and came up with these tips for drilling plexiglass:

 * use low RPM (260 in my case)
 * use a step drill bit (stepless step drill bit in my case)
 * lubricate with dish soap
 * keep the work clamped
 * go slow but don't get hot

I put two coats of epoxy in the all the new holes in the cabins. I'll mount the ports and windows after painting.
