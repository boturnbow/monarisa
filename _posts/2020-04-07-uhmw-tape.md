title:  "Adding UHMW Tape"

tag: [ beams, decks ]

With painting all done and thinking about assembly, I wanted to protect the surfaces between the decks and beams that would rub together. I also knew from past experience that the rubbing also makes a lot of noise. So I plugged some vague search terms into my favorite search engine and came across UHMW-PE tape (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene). It's used as rub strips on conveyor belts and used in automobiles to quiet pieces that rub together. Sounds great!

I ordered a roll 1/2" wide and 5 mil thick and applied to the edges of the platforms where they rub on the beams and cabin sides and each other. The adhesive didn't seem to bond well to the dimpled paint surface left from a roller. I then used a heat gun to get the adhesive moving and was happier with the results.

After the first assembly I could immediately tell that things were quieter. I'll have to wait and see if the tape holds up under use.
