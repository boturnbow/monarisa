The intent of this blog is to give back to the Wharram community. During my build, it was incredibly helpful for me to read what others had done. So I wanted to do the same for other builders and sailors. Blogs helpful to me were:

Tiki 21 blogs:
* [Beto](http://tiki21build.blogspot.com)
* [Gratitude](http://tiki21gratitude.blogspot.com)
* [Little Cat](http://tiki21littlecat.blogspot.com)

And the great community at [Wharram Builders and Friends](http://wharrambuilders.ning.com).
