## Links

The intent of this blog is to give back to the Wharram community. During my build, it was incredibly helpful for me to read what others had done. So I wanted to do the same for other builders and sailors. Tiki 21 blogs helpful to me were:

* [Beto](http://tiki21build.blogspot.com)
* [Gratitude](http://tiki21gratitude.blogspot.com)
* [Little Cat](http://tiki21littlecat.blogspot.com)

And the great community at [Wharram Builders and Friends](http://wharrambuilders.ning.com).

And just for inspiration check out [Esperantos](https://esperantos.eu) - a self-designed and built catamaran as a platform for the arts!
