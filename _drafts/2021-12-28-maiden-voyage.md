launching

assembly is difficult solo even with sliding arms on trailer
4 hours to put together
little under 4 to take apart

trailer worked well and was easy to launch and retrieve with strap

mast!
moment of disgust

motoring was tough, even the smallest boat wakes caused ventilation and racing
motor was a long shaft with lowered mount
need a super long shaft

boat was super comfortable for camping and sleeping outside
tent would be nice, but I used shade on shore when i needed it
great platform for cooking

did not spend any nights in the hulls since the weather was so pleasant

put boat straight into storage as I knew that I didn't have time to work on boat
and didn't have time to spend on the boat if launching and retrieving in a single weekend

sold the motor right away since I knew it wouldn't work
