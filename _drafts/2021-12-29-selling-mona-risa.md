I think I had known for a while that this wasn't the boat for me right now or for the next few years.

I am a fan of the Wharram design and philosophy

But doesn't work for me as an occasional sailor

Doesn't work as well as a small mono for cabin space / getting out of the elements and trailering

Goodbye to James
